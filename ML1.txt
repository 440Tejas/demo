Slip 1: Questions 1 & 2
Question 1: Use Apriori algorithm on groceries dataset to find which items are brought together. Use minimum support = 0.25. [15 Marks]
Solution:

The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. It helps in identifying which items are frequently bought together in transactional datasets.

We'll use the mlxtend library in Python to implement the Apriori algorithm. Here's how you can do it:

Code for Apriori Algorithm
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

# Loading the groceries dataset
# The dataset should be in the format where each column represents an item and each row represents a transaction
# Example: Dataset (converted to 1/0 values for each item)
groceries = pd.read_csv('groceries.csv', header=None)

# Apply the Apriori algorithm
# Use minimum support of 0.25 (this means that we will look for itemsets that appear in at least 25% of the transactions)
frequent_itemsets = apriori(groceries, min_support=0.25, use_colnames=True)

# Generating the association rules from the frequent itemsets
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1.0)

# Display the rules
print(rules)
Explanation:

Apriori is used to extract the frequent itemsets from the groceries dataset with a minimum support of 25%. This means only itemsets that appear in at least 25% of the transactions will be considered.
Association Rules are then generated using these frequent itemsets, which show the relationships between items. For example, if people buy bread, they also tend to buy butter.
Real-time Example:

In a retail store, the Apriori algorithm can be used to discover which products are often bought together. For instance, if many customers buy bread and butter together, the store could place them closer to each other to increase sales.

Question 2: Write a Python program to prepare a Scatter Plot for the Iris Dataset. Convert categorical values to numeric format. [15 Marks]
Solution:

A scatter plot is a great way to visualize relationships between two continuous variables. In the case of the Iris dataset, we can plot the petal length vs petal width for the three species of Iris flowers.

We'll use matplotlib and seaborn for plotting and pandas for data handling.

Code for Scatter Plot
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Loading the Iris dataset from seaborn
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')

# Displaying the first few rows of the dataset
print(iris.head())

# Convert the species column (categorical) to numeric values
iris['species'] = iris['species'].map({'setosa': 0, 'versicolor': 1, 'virginica': 2})

# Scatter plot for Petal Length vs Petal Width with species color-coded
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=iris, x='petal_length', y='petal_width', hue='species', palette='Set1')

# Adding labels and title
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Petal Length vs Petal Width for Iris Species')
plt.xlabel('Petal Length')
plt.ylabel('Petal Width')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
Explanation:

Seaborn loads the Iris dataset directly, and we use sns.scatterplot to create a scatter plot.
The species column is categorical (text values like "setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"). We convert this into numeric values using map() so that the colors in the plot are represented numerically.
We plot the petal length against petal width for each species, and each species is color-coded to make it visually distinct.
Real-time Example:

In machine learning tasks, particularly in supervised learning, we often encounter categorical variables that need to be converted into numeric values for the algorithms to process them. For instance, when training a model to predict the type of flower based on its features, categorical labels like "setosa" are converted to numeric values, making them usable in algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.

These answers cover the two questions for Slip 1, demonstrating the application of Apriori for association rule mining and how to visualize data using a scatter plot for the Iris dataset.

Slip 2: Questions 1 & 2
Question 1: Implement simple Linear Regression for predicting house price. First, find and remove all null values in a dataset. [15 Marks]
Solution:

For this, we will create a simple dataset containing features such as square footage of a house, number of bedrooms, and age of the house, and use Linear Regression to predict the house price.

We'll use pandas for data handling, numpy for numerical operations, and sklearn for linear regression.

Code for Linear Regression with a Custom Dataset
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Creating a custom dataset
data = {
    'square_footage': [1500, 1800, 2400, 2800, 3200, np.nan, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000],
    'num_bedrooms': [3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7],
    'age_of_house': [10, 15, 20, 12, 8, 30, 25, 5, 18, 10],
    'house_price': [400000, 450000, 600000, 650000, 700000, 300000, 750000, 800000, 900000, 950000]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the original dataset
print("Original Dataset:\n", df)

# Handling missing values by removing rows with NaN values
df = df.dropna()

# Splitting the dataset into independent variables (X) and dependent variable (y)
X = df[['square_footage', 'num_bedrooms', 'age_of_house']]
y = df['house_price']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing and training the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting house prices for the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) for evaluation
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("\nPredicted house prices:", y_pred)
print("\nMean Squared Error:", mse)
Explanation:

Dataset Creation: We created a custom dataset containing 4 columns: square_footage, num_bedrooms, age_of_house, and house_price.

Handling Missing Data: We simulated a missing value in square_footage and used dropna() to remove rows with NaN values.

Linear Regression: We split the dataset into features (X) and target (y) variables. Then, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. After training the linear regression model using fit(), we predicted the house prices on the test data.

Evaluation: The Mean Squared Error (MSE) was calculated to assess the accuracy of our predictions.

Real-time Example:

In real estate, predicting house prices based on features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the age of the house is a typical task for linear regression models. For instance, a real estate agent can use such a model to estimate the price of a property based on these features.

Question 2: Use the Wholesale customer dataset for agglomerative clustering to find annual spending clients in the same region. [15 Marks]
Solution:

We'll create a custom dataset that simulates the Wholesale customer data, including variables like region, annual_spending_on_grocery, annual_spending_on_beverages, and annual_spending_on_dairy. We will then apply Agglomerative Clustering to identify clients who spend similarly across these categories.

Code for Agglomerative Clustering with Custom Dataset
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Creating a custom dataset for Wholesale customers
data = {
    'region': ['North', 'South', 'East', 'West', 'North', 'South', 'East', 'West', 'North', 'South'],
    'annual_spending_on_grocery': [12000, 13000, 8000, 9000, 11500, 14000, 9500, 10500, 12500, 15000],
    'annual_spending_on_beverages': [3000, 3500, 2000, 2500, 2700, 3700, 2200, 2700, 3200, 3800],
    'annual_spending_on_dairy': [1500, 1600, 1200, 1400, 1350, 1700, 1300, 1500, 1550, 1800]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Dropping the region column as we will cluster based on spending patterns, not regions
X = df.drop('region', axis=1)

# Initializing and fitting the Agglomerative Clustering model
agg_clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=3)  # We aim to find 3 clusters
df['cluster'] = agg_clustering.fit_predict(X)

# Display the dataset with cluster labels
print(df)

# Plotting the clusters based on two features (grocery and beverages spending)
plt.scatter(df['annual_spending_on_grocery'], df['annual_spending_on_beverages'], c=df['cluster'], cmap='rainbow')
plt.title('Agglomerative Clustering: Spending Behavior')
plt.xlabel('Annual Spending on Grocery')
plt.ylabel('Annual Spending on Beverages')
plt.show()
Explanation:

Dataset Creation: We created a custom dataset representing Wholesale customer spending on three categories: grocery, beverages, and dairy. We also included a region column, but we exclude it from clustering since we are interested in spending patterns.

Agglomerative Clustering: We used the AgglomerativeClustering algorithm to find 3 clusters of customers based on their spending patterns. Each cluster represents a group of customers with similar annual spending behavior.

Visualization: We plotted the data points with different colors representing each cluster. The x-axis represents grocery spending, and the y-axis represents beverage spending.

Real-time Example:

In retail, clustering customers based on their spending habits can help businesses target specific groups for marketing campaigns. For instance, customers who spend more on groceries and beverages could be targeted with promotions or discounts in those categories.

These solutions cover the implementation of Linear Regression for house price prediction and the use of Agglomerative Clustering for customer segmentation based on spending. The custom datasets make these examples more practical and relevant for real-world applications.

Slip 3: Questions 1 & 2
Question 1: Implement multiple Linear Regression for a house price dataset. Split data into training and testing sets. [15 Marks]
Solution:

In this question, we will use a dataset to predict the house price based on multiple features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, age of the house, and number of bathrooms. We will apply Multiple Linear Regression to predict house prices and split the data into training and testing sets.

Code for Multiple Linear Regression
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Creating a custom house price dataset
data = {
    'square_footage': [1500, 1800, 2400, 2800, 3200, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500],
    'num_bedrooms': [3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7],
    'num_bathrooms': [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6],
    'age_of_house': [10, 15, 20, 12, 8, 30, 25, 5, 18, 10],
    'house_price': [400000, 450000, 600000, 650000, 700000, 750000, 800000, 850000, 900000, 950000]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Splitting the dataset into independent variables (X) and dependent variable (y)
X = df[['square_footage', 'num_bedrooms', 'num_bathrooms', 'age_of_house']]
y = df['house_price']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Training the model with the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting house prices on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted house prices:", y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
Explanation:

Dataset Creation: We create a custom dataset with multiple features (square_footage, num_bedrooms, num_bathrooms, and age_of_house) and the target variable house_price.

Training and Testing Split: We split the dataset into 80% training data and 20% testing data using train_test_split() from sklearn.

Multiple Linear Regression: We initialize a LinearRegression model, fit it with the training data, and predict house prices using the test data.

Evaluation: We calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the accuracy of the model. A lower MSE indicates a better model.

Real-time Example:

In real estate, multiple linear regression can be used to estimate house prices based on various features like size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the age of the house. This helps realtors or potential buyers make more informed decisions about property pricing.

Question 2: Use logistic regression on crash.csv to predict survivability based on age and speed. [15 Marks]
Solution:

In this question, we assume the crash.csv dataset contains information on car crash incidents with the features age (age of the driver) and speed (speed of the vehicle at the time of the crash). We will use Logistic Regression to predict whether the crash resulted in survival (1) or fatality (0).

Let's create a synthetic crash.csv dataset to simulate this scenario.

Code for Logistic Regression
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Creating a synthetic dataset simulating crash data
data = {
    'age': [25, 30, 22, 40, 50, 60, 35, 27, 23, 29],
    'speed': [55, 60, 45, 70, 80, 60, 65, 58, 50, 48],
    'survival': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]  # 1 = survived, 0 = fatality
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Splitting the dataset into features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['age', 'speed']]
y = df['survival']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Training the model with the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting survivability for the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted survivability:", y_pred)
print("Accuracy of the model:", accuracy)
Explanation:

Dataset Creation: We simulate a dataset with age, speed, and survival columns. The target variable survival is binary (1 for survival, 0 for fatality).

Logistic Regression: We use LogisticRegression from sklearn to build a model that predicts the probability of survival based on the age and speed of the driver.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model's accuracy using accuracy_score, which measures how often the model correctly predicts the survival status.

Real-time Example:

Logistic regression is often used in medical, financial, and safety-related fields to predict binary outcomes. In this case, it helps predict the survivability of drivers in a crash, based on factors such as age and speed. This model can assist in identifying the risk factors for fatal accidents.

These solutions cover:

Multiple Linear Regression to predict house prices based on multiple features.
Logistic Regression for binary classification to predict crash survivability based on driver age and speed.
Both are common machine learning tasks that have real-world applications in fields like real estate and traffic safety analysis.

Slip 4: Questions 1 & 2
Question 1: Implement k-means algorithm on a mall_customers dataset. [15 Marks]
Solution:

In this question, we'll use a synthetic mall_customers dataset with customer data like age, annual_income, and spending_score. The goal is to use K-means clustering to group customers into clusters based on their shopping behavior.

We will apply the K-means clustering algorithm to identify clusters of customers with similar shopping habits. We will visualize the results in a scatter plot.

Code for K-means Clustering on a Custom Dataset
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Creating a synthetic dataset representing mall customers
data = {
    'age': [25, 34, 29, 41, 23, 35, 43, 50, 37, 22],
    'annual_income': [40000, 50000, 60000, 80000, 30000, 40000, 90000, 70000, 80000, 60000],
    'spending_score': [39, 81, 6, 77, 40, 76, 6, 94, 3, 72]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Standardizing the data (important for K-means)
scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df)

# Applying K-means clustering with 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(df_scaled)

# Displaying the resulting DataFrame with cluster labels
print(df)

# Plotting the clusters
plt.scatter(df['annual_income'], df['spending_score'], c=df['cluster'], cmap='rainbow')
plt.title('Customer Segments Based on Spending Behavior')
plt.xlabel('Annual Income')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score')
plt.show()
Explanation:

Dataset Creation: We created a synthetic mall_customers dataset with 3 columns: age, annual_income, and spending_score.

Data Scaling: Before applying the K-means algorithm, we standardize the data using StandardScaler to normalize the features, ensuring all features have similar scales for better clustering performance.

K-means Clustering: We apply the KMeans algorithm to the standardized data with 3 clusters (representing different groups of customers).

Visualization: We plot the customers' data points on a 2D scatter plot, using annual_income and spending_score as the axes and color-coding the points based on their assigned cluster.

Real-time Example:

Retail businesses can use clustering to group customers based on their spending behavior and income. This allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies or promotions to different customer segments. For instance, high-income customers with high spending scores could be targeted with premium offers.

Question 2: Implement Simple Linear Regression for predicting house price. [15 Marks]
Solution:

This question requires us to implement Simple Linear Regression to predict house prices based on a single feature, such as square footage. We will create a dataset with a single feature (square footage of the house) and predict the house price using linear regression.

Code for Simple Linear Regression
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Creating a custom dataset for house price prediction based on square footage
data = {
    'square_footage': [1500, 1800, 2400, 2800, 3200, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000, 5500],
    'house_price': [400000, 450000, 600000, 650000, 700000, 750000, 800000, 850000, 900000, 950000]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Splitting the dataset into independent variable (X) and dependent variable (y)
X = df[['square_footage']]
y = df['house_price']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing the Simple Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Training the model with the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting house prices on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted house prices:", y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
Explanation:

Dataset Creation: We create a custom dataset with two columns: square_footage (independent variable) and house_price (dependent variable).

Simple Linear Regression: We use Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between square footage and house price. We split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.

Model Evaluation: After training the model, we predict house prices using the test data and evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Real-time Example:

In real estate, simple linear regression is often used to predict house prices based on one primary factor such as the size of the house. This model can help real estate agents provide rough estimates of house prices based on the square footage.

These solutions cover:

K-means Clustering to segment customers based on their shopping behavior.
Simple Linear Regression to predict house prices based on square footage.
Both are fundamental techniques that have broad applications in customer segmentation and price prediction models in real-world business contexts.

The warning and error message you're seeing suggests an issue with the system detecting the physical cores of your CPU while using the joblib library, which is commonly used in parallel computing tasks (like with scikit-learn).

Here’s an explanation of what's happening and a possible solution:

Explanation:
The warning indicates that joblib cannot determine the physical core count of your CPU, likely due to missing or incorrect system configuration on Windows. This usually doesn't impact the functionality of your code but may affect parallel computations that try to optimize performance by using the correct number of cores.
The issue occurs because joblib tries to find the physical core count, which may require running a system command that isn't supported or available on your system.
Possible Fixes:
Suppress the warning: If you don’t want to see the warning, you can set the environment variable LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT to the number of cores you want to use. You can also just ignore it since it won't typically break your code.

python
Copy code
import os
os.environ['LOKY_MAX_CPU_COUNT'] = '4'  # Change to your desired number of cores
Alternatively, you can directly silence the warning by suppressing it in your script:

python
Copy code
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning, message=".*Could not find the number of physical cores.*")
Install/Update joblib and loky: Ensure that your libraries are up to date. Sometimes this issue can be caused by outdated versions of joblib or loky, which may not work well on newer systems. You can update them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade joblib loky
Manually set the number of CPUs: If you are explicitly using joblib or scikit-learn for parallel processing, you can control the number of threads/CPUs directly by specifying it manually.

For example, when using joblib with scikit-learn:

python
Copy code
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

Parallel(n_jobs=4)(delayed(some_function)(i) for i in range(10))  # Manually set n_jobs to 4
Check your system’s environment: It could be a specific issue with your system's configuration. You can check if your environment variables are set correctly and try running other CPU-intensive processes to verify your system’s CPU configuration.

Conclusion:
The warning itself is not critical and will likely not stop your code from running. If it’s just a warning, you can suppress it, or if you prefer, set the number of cores manually in your code or by updating your libraries. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Slip 5: Questions 1 & 2
Question 1: Implement Multiple Linear Regression for a Fuel Consumption dataset. [15 Marks]
Solution:

In this question, we'll use a synthetic Fuel Consumption dataset to predict the Fuel Consumption based on features like Engine Size, Cylinders, and Horsepower. Multiple linear regression will be used to model the relationship between these features and the target variable (Fuel Consumption).

Code for Multiple Linear Regression on a Fuel Consumption Dataset
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# Creating a synthetic dataset for fuel consumption prediction
data = {
    'engine_size': [2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 2.0, 2.8, 3.2, 4.5, 5.0, 3.6],
    'cylinders': [4, 6, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 6],
    'horsepower': [150, 200, 250, 300, 130, 180, 220, 350, 400, 280],
    'fuel_consumption': [8.5, 10.5, 12.0, 14.5, 7.0, 8.8, 11.0, 15.0, 17.5, 13.0]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features (independent variables) and Target (dependent variable)
X = df[['engine_size', 'cylinders', 'horsepower']]
y = df['fuel_consumption']

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing the Multiple Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Training the model with the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting fuel consumption on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted fuel consumption:", y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
Explanation:

Dataset Creation: We create a synthetic Fuel Consumption dataset with four columns: engine_size, cylinders, horsepower, and fuel_consumption.

Multiple Linear Regression: We use Multiple Linear Regression to predict fuel_consumption based on the features engine_size, cylinders, and horsepower.

Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing) to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Evaluation: After training the model, we predict fuel consumption on the test set and calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a metric to evaluate the model's accuracy.

Real-time Example:

In the automotive industry, multiple linear regression can be used to predict a car's fuel consumption based on various factors like engine size, horsepower, and number of cylinders. This can help manufacturers or customers assess a car's fuel efficiency based on its technical specifications.

Question 2: Implement k-nearest Neighbors (KNN) ML algorithm using the Iris Dataset. [15 Marks]
Solution:

In this question, we will use the Iris Dataset and implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify flowers into three species based on their features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width.

Code for K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on the Iris Dataset
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Loading the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
y = iris.target  # Target (species)

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initializing the KNN model with K=3 (3 nearest neighbors)
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Training the model with the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the species on the test data
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Calculating the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted species:", y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
Explanation:

Dataset: The Iris dataset is loaded from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. It contains data about 150 Iris flowers, with features such as sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, and petal_width, and the target variable is the species of the flower.

KNN Classifier: We use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify flowers into three species based on the four features.

Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate how well the model generalizes.

Model Evaluation: After training the model, we predict the species for the test data and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.

Real-time Example:

The KNN algorithm can be used in a variety of classification tasks, such as identifying plant species based on their characteristics (e.g., petals, leaves, etc.). In agriculture, KNN could help categorize different types of plants based on their physical features.

These solutions cover:

Multiple Linear Regression to predict fuel consumption based on multiple features.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify flowers in the Iris dataset based on their physical attributes.
Both techniques are widely used in real-world applications, such as in automotive industries for fuel prediction and in biology for classifying species.

Slip 6: Questions 1 & 2
Question 1: Implement Polynomial Linear Regression on the Boston Housing Dataset. [15 Marks]
Solution:

In this question, we will use Polynomial Linear Regression to model the relationship between the features of the Boston Housing dataset and the target variable, which is the housing price. Polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships by introducing polynomial terms.

Code for Polynomial Regression on the Boston Housing Dataset
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Loading the Boston Housing dataset
boston = load_boston()
X = boston.data  # Features
y = boston.target  # Target (house price)

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Applying Polynomial Features (degree 2)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)

# Initializing the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Training the model with the transformed data
model.fit(X_train_poly, y_train)

# Predicting the house prices on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_poly)

# Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted House Prices:", y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse)
Explanation:

Dataset: The Boston Housing dataset, available in scikit-learn, contains data on housing prices in Boston based on several features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rates.

Polynomial Features: We apply polynomial features transformation using PolynomialFeatures(degree=2) to create interaction terms and higher-order features to better capture the non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.

Linear Regression: After transforming the features, we use Linear Regression to fit the data and predict house prices.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which gives us an idea of how well the model is performing.

Real-time Example:

In the real estate industry, polynomial regression can be used to predict house prices more accurately by considering non-linear relationships between features such as square footage, number of rooms, and location, which may affect pricing in more complex ways.

Question 2: Use K-means clustering to classify employees into income groups (preprocess data if required). [15 Marks]
Solution:

In this question, we will use the K-means clustering algorithm to classify employees into income groups based on features like age, years of experience, and education level. K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points into a predefined number of clusters.

Code for K-means Clustering on Employee Income Groups
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Creating a synthetic dataset for employee classification into income groups
data = {
    'age': [22, 34, 45, 23, 34, 56, 60, 35, 40, 50],
    'years_of_experience': [1, 10, 20, 2, 8, 25, 30, 7, 10, 15],
    'education_level': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3],  # 1: High School, 2: Bachelor's, 3: Master's
    'income': [35000, 50000, 80000, 38000, 45000, 95000, 120000, 47000, 55000, 70000]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features: Age, Years of Experience, Education Level
X = df[['age', 'years_of_experience', 'education_level']]

# Standardizing the features for better K-means performance
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Initializing the K-means model with 3 clusters (for 3 income groups)
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)

# Fitting the K-means model to the data
kmeans.fit(X_scaled)

# Assigning the cluster labels to the original dataframe
df['income_group'] = kmeans.labels_

# Viewing the resulting clusters
print(df[['age', 'years_of_experience', 'education_level', 'income_group']])
Explanation:

Dataset: A synthetic dataset is created with features: age, years_of_experience, education_level (coded as 1, 2, 3), and income. The target variable income is not used for clustering, but it helps understand how the clusters map to different income groups.

Standardization: We standardize the data using StandardScaler because K-means clustering is sensitive to the scale of features. This ensures all features contribute equally to the clustering process.

K-means Clustering: The K-means algorithm is applied to the data, specifying n_clusters=3 to group employees into three income groups.

Cluster Assignment: The model assigns a cluster label to each employee, which is stored in the new income_group column.

Real-time Example:

In a company, K-means clustering can be used to segment employees into different income brackets based on features such as experience, age, and education level. These segments can then be used to tailor compensation packages, training programs, or promotions based on the characteristics of each income group.

Conclusion:
In Slip 6, we covered two important topics:

Polynomial Linear Regression on the Boston Housing dataset to model the relationship between features and housing prices.
K-means Clustering to classify employees into different income groups based on their characteristics.
Both techniques are widely used in industry for regression and clustering tasks.

ImportError: 
load_boston has been removed from scikit-learn since version 1.2.

The Boston housing prices dataset has an ethical problem: as
investigated in [1], the authors of this dataset engineered a
non-invertible variable "B" assuming that racial self-segregation had a
positive impact on house prices [2]. Furthermore the goal of the
research that led to the creation of this dataset was to study the
impact of air quality but it did not give adequate demonstration of the
validity of this assumption.

The scikit-learn maintainers therefore strongly discourage the use of
this dataset unless the purpose of the code is to study and educate
about ethical issues in data science and machine learning.

In this special case, you can fetch the dataset from the original
source::

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    data_url = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston"
    raw_df = pd.read_csv(data_url, sep="\s+", skiprows=22, header=None)
    data = np.hstack([raw_df.values[::2, :], raw_df.values[1::2, :2]])
    target = raw_df.values[1::2, 2]

Alternative datasets include the California housing dataset and the
Ames housing dataset. You can load the datasets as follows::

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
    housing = fetch_california_housing()

for the California housing dataset and::

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    housing = fetch_openml(name="house_prices", as_frame=True)

for the Ames housing dataset.

The Boston Housing dataset has been removed from scikit-learn due to ethical concerns related to the dataset. Instead, you can use other datasets such as the California Housing dataset or the Ames Housing dataset. Here's how you can modify the code to use the California Housing dataset:

Updated Code Using California Housing Dataset
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Loading the California Housing dataset
california_housing = fetch_california_housing()
X = california_housing.data  # Features
y = california_housing.target  # Target (house price)

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Applying Polynomial Features (degree 2)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)

# Initializing the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Training the model with the transformed data
model.fit(X_train_poly, y_train)

# Predicting the house prices on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_poly)

# Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted House Prices:", y_pred[:10])  # Displaying the first 10 predicted prices
print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse)
Explanation of Changes:
California Housing Dataset: We switched to using the California Housing dataset (from fetch_california_housing()), which contains similar features like the Boston Housing dataset but does not have the ethical concerns.

Model and Evaluation: The process of applying Polynomial Features, training the Linear Regression model, and evaluating it using Mean Squared Error remains the same.

Real-Time Example:
This dataset is often used for predicting real estate prices, and polynomial regression can help capture more complex relationships between the features (e.g., population density, household income, etc.) and the housing prices.

Here is the solution for Question 2 in Slip 6 where we use K-means clustering to classify employees into income groups based on their features (like age, years of experience, and education level). A synthetic dataset will be created to demonstrate this.

Code for K-means Clustering on Employee Income Groups
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Creating a synthetic dataset for employee classification into income groups
data = {
    'age': [22, 34, 45, 23, 34, 56, 60, 35, 40, 50],
    'years_of_experience': [1, 10, 20, 2, 8, 25, 30, 7, 10, 15],
    'education_level': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3],  # 1: High School, 2: Bachelor's, 3: Master's
    'income': [35000, 50000, 80000, 38000, 45000, 95000, 120000, 47000, 55000, 70000]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features: Age, Years of Experience, Education Level (These will be used for clustering)
X = df[['age', 'years_of_experience', 'education_level']]

# Standardizing the features for better K-means performance
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Initializing the K-means model with 3 clusters (assuming 3 income groups)
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)

# Fitting the K-means model to the data
kmeans.fit(X_scaled)

# Assigning the cluster labels to the original dataframe
df['income_group'] = kmeans.labels_

# Viewing the resulting clusters
print(df[['age', 'years_of_experience', 'education_level', 'income_group']])
Explanation of Code:
Dataset Creation:

A synthetic dataset for employees is created, including columns such as age, years_of_experience, education_level (which indicates the highest education level of the employee), and income. The income is what we want to predict based on the clustering.
Features for Clustering:

The clustering is based on age, years_of_experience, and education_level. These features are used to determine the clusters of income groups.
Standardization:

Since K-means is sensitive to the scale of the features, we standardize the data using StandardScaler so that all features contribute equally to the clustering.
K-means Clustering:

We set n_clusters=3 since we are assuming that there are 3 income groups (e.g., low, medium, and high income).
The K-means algorithm is then applied to classify the employees into the 3 income groups.
Result:

The cluster labels (which represent the income group) are added to the original dataframe as a new column income_group.
The final output will display the features of each employee along with the assigned income group.

    'windy': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],  # 1: Yes, 0: No
    'outlook': ['Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Rainy', 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Rainy']
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Converting categorical variables to numeric
df['outlook'] = df['outlook'].map({'Sunny': 1, 'Rainy': 0})

# Features and Target
X = df[['temperature', 'humidity', 'windy']]  # Independent variables
y = df['outlook']  # Target variable

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initializing the Naive Bayes classifier
model = GaussianNB()

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Checking the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy of Naive Bayes Model: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
Explanation:
Dataset: A synthetic dataset representing weather conditions (temperature, humidity, and windy) along with the outlook (which is either "Sunny" or "Rainy").
Naive Bayes Classifier: The Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is used to predict the outlook (Sunny or Rainy) based on the input features.
Prediction: The model is trained and tested, and its accuracy is evaluated on the test set.
Real-Time Example:
In weather forecasting, Naive Bayes classifiers can be used to predict the probability of certain weather conditions, such as "Sunny" or "Rainy", based on inputs like temperature, humidity, and wind conditions. It's commonly used due to its simplicity and efficiency for such tasks.

The warning you are seeing occurs because the model was trained using a DataFrame that included feature names (like 'level'), but when you pass the data for prediction, it doesn't include feature names (just plain arrays or lists).

To fix this, make sure that when you predict the new values, you pass the input in the same format (DataFrame or 2D array) that the model was trained on. Here's an updated version of the code to resolve this:

Updated Code:
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Creating a synthetic dataset for the Salary Positions CSV file (Assuming the dataset)
data = {
    'level': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
    'salary': [40000, 42000, 44000, 46000, 48000, 50000, 52000, 54000, 56000, 58000, 60000, 62000]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features (Level) and Target (Salary)
X = df[['level']]  # Independent variable (Level)
y = df['salary']   # Dependent variable (Salary)

# Initializing and training the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predicting salary for level 11 and 12
predicted_salaries = model.predict(np.array([[11], [12]]))  # Ensure using np.array for prediction

# Output the predicted salaries
print(f"Predicted salary for level 11: {predicted_salaries[0]}")
print(f"Predicted salary for level 12: {predicted_salaries[1]}")
Explanation:
Prediction Input: The input data for prediction np.array([[11], [12]]) is now wrapped in np.array() to match the format expected by the model. The model was trained using a pandas DataFrame, but during prediction, you need to use a numpy array or DataFrame with the same feature names and shape.
No Warning: By passing np.array([[11], [12]]), you avoid the warning about mismatched feature names.
This should resolve the issue you're encountering. Let me know if the problem persists or if you need further assistance!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The warning is happening because the model was trained using a pandas DataFrame (which contains feature names like 'level'), but when you predict, you're passing a NumPy array without column names.

To resolve this, you can ensure that when making predictions, you use a DataFrame instead of a NumPy array. This way, the model will recognize the feature names correctly.

Here’s how you can modify the code:

Updated Code:
python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Creating a synthetic dataset for the Salary Positions CSV file (Assuming the dataset)
data = {
    'level': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
    'salary': [40000, 42000, 44000, 46000, 48000, 50000, 52000, 54000, 56000, 58000, 60000, 62000]
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features (Level) and Target (Salary)
X = df[['level']]  # Independent variable (Level)
y = df['salary']   # Dependent variable (Salary)

# Initializing and training the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predicting salary for level 11 and 12 using a DataFrame for prediction
predicted_salaries = model.predict(pd.DataFrame([[11], [12]], columns=['level']))  # Use DataFrame with feature name

# Output the predicted salaries
print(f"Predicted salary for level 11: {predicted_salaries[0]}")
print(f"Predicted salary for level 12: {predicted_salaries[1]}")
Key Changes:
Using DataFrame for Prediction: When predicting for levels 11 and 12, I've used pd.DataFrame([[11], [12]], columns=['level']) to pass the input as a DataFrame with the column name 'level'. This matches the format in which the model was trained.
No Warning: The warning should no longer appear, because the model now recognizes the feature names in the prediction input.
Explanation:
Feature Names: Scikit-learn's LinearRegression expects the features during training and prediction to have the same format, which includes the feature names (in this case, the column name 'level').
DataFrame in Prediction: By using a DataFrame for prediction (with the correct column names), you maintain consistency with how the model was trained.
Try running this updated code, and the warning should be resolved. Let me know if you need further help!

Here's the solution for Slip 3, which involves implementing multiple linear regression on a house price dataset. Let's also include an example dataset.

Slip 3
Implement Multiple Linear Regression for a House Price Dataset. Split data into training and testing sets.
Use Logistic Regression on crash.csv to predict survivability based on age and speed.
We'll create a synthetic house price dataset for the first part, and then proceed with the second task as requested.

Code for Slip 3, Question 1: Multiple Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
Let's assume a simple house price prediction dataset with features like the number of rooms, size of the house, and location (as a numeric value for simplicity). We'll split this dataset into training and testing sets, and perform the regression.

python
Copy code
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Creating a synthetic dataset for House Prices
data = {
    'rooms': [3, 4, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4],
    'size': [1500, 1800, 1200, 2500, 3200, 1400, 2000, 2800, 1300, 2100],  # Size in square feet
    'location': [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2],  # Numeric location (1=City, 2=Suburbs, 3=Countryside)
    'price': [300000, 400000, 350000, 600000, 750000, 330000, 450000, 650000, 340000, 460000]  # Price in USD
}

# Converting the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features (X) and Target (y)
X = df[['rooms', 'size', 'location']]  # Independent variables
y = df['price']  # Dependent variable (Price)

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)

# Initializing and training the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the house prices on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

Here’s how we can tackle Slip 8. For Slip 8, the two tasks are:

Categorize news text into 20 categories using multinomial Naive Bayes.
Implement a Decision Tree for "Play Tennis" decision-making.
Let's break down the two questions:
Question 1: Categorize News Text into 20 Categories Using Multinomial Naive Bayes
We will use the 20 Newsgroups Dataset from scikit-learn, which is already pre-loaded and contains news articles categorized into 20 different groups. We'll preprocess the data, then use Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification.

Step-by-Step Implementation:
Load the 20 newsgroups dataset.
Preprocess the data (remove stop words and vectorize the text).
Train the model using Multinomial Naive Bayes.
Evaluate the model.
Code for Question 1:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the 20 newsgroups dataset
newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all')

# Vectorizing the text data (Converting text to numerical data)
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')  # Remove stopwords
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups.data)
y = newsgroups.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Naive Bayes classifier
nb = MultinomialNB()

# Train the classifier
nb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = nb.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Explanation:
fetch_20newsgroups(): This function loads the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
CountVectorizer(): Converts the text data into numerical features. The stop_words='english' argument removes common words (like "the", "is", etc.) which are not helpful for classification.
MultinomialNB(): This is the classifier we use for text classification. It assumes that features (words) are conditionally independent given the class, making it suitable for text data.
train_test_split(): This splits the dataset into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%).
accuracy_score() and classification_report(): These functions evaluate the model's performance.
Question 2: Implement a Decision Tree for "Play Tennis" Decision-Making
We will create a simple decision tree to predict whether a person would play tennis based on weather conditions. Here's how we can proceed:

Create a synthetic dataset with weather conditions (like "Sunny", "Overcast", "Rainy").
Implement a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether they play tennis or not.
Evaluate the model.
Code for Question 2:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import pandas as pd

# Create a synthetic dataset for the "Play Tennis" decision-making problem
data = {
    'outlook': ['Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Overcast', 'Rainy', 'Rainy', 'Rainy', 'Overcast', 'Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Overcast'],
    'temperature': ['Hot', 'Hot', 'Hot', 'Mild', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Mild', 'Mild', 'Mild', 'Hot', 'Mild'],
    'humidity': ['High', 'High', 'High', 'High', 'High', 'Low', 'Low', 'Low', 'Low', 'High', 'Low', 'Low'],
    'wind': ['Weak', 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Strong', 'Strong'],
    'play_tennis': ['No', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes']
}

# Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert categorical variables into numerical values
df = pd.get_dummies(df)

# Features and target variable
X = df.drop('play_tennis_Yes', axis=1)  # Features (all except target)
y = df['play_tennis_Yes']  # Target variable (1 for "Yes", 0 for "No")

# Train the Decision Tree classifier
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
dt.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
y_pred = dt.predict(X)

# Evaluate the model
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y, y_pred)}")
Explanation:
Synthetic Data: We create a simple dataset with columns representing weather conditions and a target variable (play_tennis).
pd.get_dummies(): This function is used to convert categorical variables (like "Sunny", "Hot", etc.) into numerical columns, which can be used in machine learning models.
Decision Tree Classifier: The DecisionTreeClassifier() is used to build a decision tree based on the given features.
Accuracy: The accuracy score measures how well the decision tree model performs.
Summary:
Multinomial Naive Bayes for classifying text into categories.
Decision Tree for predicting the decision to "Play Tennis" based on weather data.
Both solutions provide an introduction to these algorithms and their applications. Let me know if you'd like further explanation or additional details!

it is taking too much of time

It seems that the 20 Newsgroups dataset can be quite large and might take some time to process, especially when vectorizing the text and training the model. There are a few ways to speed up the process or reduce the resource usage:

1. Use a Subset of the Dataset
If you're only testing or learning, you can reduce the dataset size by loading only a subset of the 20 Newsgroups data. This can significantly improve the performance during training and evaluation.

Modify the dataset loading to fetch a smaller subset:
python
Copy code
# Load a smaller subset of the 20 newsgroups dataset (e.g., just 5 categories)
newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', categories=newsgroups.target_names[:5])  # Limit to 5 categories

# Vectorizing the text data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups.data)
y = newsgroups.target

# Proceed with the same code...
This will reduce the total number of categories from 20 to just 5, making the task faster.

2. Use TfidfVectorizer
The CountVectorizer can be slow for large text datasets. Switching to TfidfVectorizer might help in reducing the time taken for vectorization, as it works more efficiently and generally performs better for text classification tasks.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Use TfidfVectorizer instead of CountVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups.data)
3. Limit the Number of Features
You can also limit the number of features by setting a maximum number of features in the vectorizer. This can reduce the number of dimensions, making the model faster.

python
Copy code
# Limit to the top 1000 features (most frequent words)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=1000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups.data)
4. Use a Different Model
Naive Bayes with large datasets can be slow. If time is crucial, you might want to experiment with faster models such as Logistic Regression or LinearSVC, which can be more efficient for high-dimensional datasets.

Here’s how you can modify the model:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Use Logistic Regression instead of Naive Bayes
lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
5. Use Parallelism for Training
Scikit-learn allows you to use multiple CPU cores during model training by setting the n_jobs parameter. For example, with LogisticRegression, you can use:

python
Copy code
# Train the model using multiple CPUs
lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, n_jobs=-1)  # Use all cores
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
This can speed up training if you have multiple CPU cores.

By combining some of these optimizations, you should be able to significantly reduce the computation time. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!

Here is the modified code with optimizations to improve speed and resource usage:

Subset of the dataset to reduce the total categories.
Use TfidfVectorizer for faster and more efficient vectorization.
Limit the number of features by using max_features=1000 to reduce dimensionality.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load a smaller subset of the 20 newsgroups dataset (e.g., just 5 categories)
newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', categories=['rec.sport.baseball', 'sci.med', 'comp.sys.mac.hardware', 'talk.politics.mideast', 'rec.autos'])

# Vectorizing the text data using TfidfVectorizer (with limited features)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=1000)  # Limit to 1000 most frequent words
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups.data)
y = newsgroups.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Logistic Regression model (more efficient for text classification)
lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, n_jobs=-1)  # Use all cores for training

# Train the classifier
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Key Changes:
Subset the dataset: I reduced the categories to 5 for faster processing.
Use TfidfVectorizer: Replaced CountVectorizer with TfidfVectorizer and limited the number of features to the top 1000 most frequent words.
Use LogisticRegression: Switched from Naive Bayes to Logistic Regression, which tends to train faster for text classification tasks.
Parallelism with n_jobs=-1: This will allow the logistic regression model to use all available CPU cores, speeding up training.
Expected Outcome:
Faster execution due to reduced dataset size and optimized vectorization.
Improved training time with LogisticRegression and parallelism.

Implement Ridge and Lasso Regression on a housing dataset to predict house prices based on specific features. Use the RM (number of rooms) and Price columns to train the models, and visualize the regression lines.

Implement Linear SVM using a sample bank customer dataset for classification tasks.

Here’s the code with synthetic datasets created for each question.

1. Ridge and Lasso Regression on a Sample Housing Dataset
Since load_boston is deprecated, we'll use synthetic data with features similar to what you’d find in a typical housing dataset.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data (housing-like dataset)
np.random.seed(0)
num_samples = 100
rooms = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=num_samples)  # Random room numbers
prices = rooms * 50000 + np.random.normal(0, 10000, size=num_samples)  # Price with some noise

# Create a DataFrame
housing_df = pd.DataFrame({'Rooms': rooms, 'Price': prices})

# Split the data into features and target
X = housing_df[['Rooms']]
y = housing_df['Price']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Ridge Regression
ridge_reg = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
ridge_pred = ridge_reg.predict(X_test)

# Lasso Regression
lasso_reg = Lasso(alpha=1.0)
lasso_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
lasso_pred = lasso_reg.predict(X_test)

# Calculate and print Mean Squared Errors
ridge_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, ridge_pred)
lasso_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, lasso_pred)
print(f"Ridge Regression MSE: {ridge_mse}")
print(f"Lasso Regression MSE: {lasso_mse}")

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.scatter(X, y, color="blue", label="Data Points")
plt.plot(X_test, ridge_pred, color="green", label="Ridge Regression Line")
plt.plot(X_test, lasso_pred, color="red", label="Lasso Regression Line")
plt.xlabel("Rooms")
plt.ylabel("Price")
plt.title("Ridge and Lasso Regression")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
2. Linear SVM on a Sample Bank Customer Dataset
This example creates a sample dataset resembling a customer classification task.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Generate synthetic bank customer dataset
np.random.seed(1)
num_customers = 200
age = np.random.randint(18, 70, size=num_customers)  # Random ages between 18 and 70
income = np.random.randint(20000, 100000, size=num_customers)  # Income range
# Customer segments: 0 = Low-value, 1 = High-value
customer_segment = np.where((age > 30) & (income > 50000), 1, 0)

# Create a DataFrame
bank_df = pd.DataFrame({'Age': age, 'Income': income, 'Segment': customer_segment})

# Split data into features and target
X = bank_df[['Age', 'Income']]
y = bank_df['Segment']

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train SVM classifier
svm = SVC(kernel="linear", random_state=42)
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test data
y_pred = svm.predict(X_test)

# Classification report
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Explanation
Ridge and Lasso Regression: These models use regularization techniques to predict Price based on Rooms. The MSE values indicate the prediction error, and the plot shows the regression lines for Ridge and Lasso.
Linear SVM: This model classifies customers as low or high value based on Age and Income. The output provides a classification report with precision, recall, and F1 scores for model evaluation.

Perform PCA on the Iris dataset to reduce it from 4 dimensions to 2 dimensions, then plot the transformed data.

Prepare a Scatter Plot for the Iris Dataset after converting categorical values to numerical format.

1. PCA on the Iris Dataset
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of data. Here we’ll project the Iris dataset into 2D for visualization.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data

2. Scatter Plot for the Iris Dataset with Categorical to Numerical Conversion
To visualize the Iris dataset, we first convert its categorical target labels into numerical values (if not already done) and then plot a scatter plot.

python
Copy code
# Import libraries
import seaborn as sns

# Load Iris dataset
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
iris_df['Species'] = iris.target

# Plotting Scatter Plot for Sepal Length vs Sepal Width, colored by Species

sns.scatterplot(data=iris_df, x="sepal length (cm)", y="sepal width (cm)", hue="Species", palette="deep")
plt.title("Scatter Plot of Sepal Length vs Sepal Width (Iris Dataset)")
plt.xlabel("Sepal Length (cm)")
plt.ylabel("Sepal Width (cm)")
plt.legend(title="Species", labels=iris.target_names)

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = data.data[:, :1]  # Using only one feature for simplicity
y = data.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply Polynomial Features transformation (degree = 2)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_train_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)

# Train a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_poly, y_train)

# Predictions and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_poly)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# Displaying results
print("Sample Predictions:", y_pred[:5])
2. Decision Tree Classifier for Banknote Authentication Dataset
To classify banknotes as genuine or counterfeit, we’ll use a sample dataset available on the UCI repository. Here’s an example using random sample data that mimics banknote authentication data structure.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Initialize and train the Decision Tree Classifier
dt_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
dt_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions and evaluation
y_pred = dt_classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Explanation

The warning here is caused by using input arrays for prediction without feature names after fitting the model with a DataFrame (which has feature names). We can resolve this by either converting the input to a DataFrame with the same feature name or by using .reshape(-1, 1) on the input arrays for predict calls. Here’s the updated code with these adjustments:

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Creating a synthetic Salary Position dataset
data = {'Position Level': np.arange(1, 11),
        'Salary': [45000, 50000, 60000, 80000, 110000, 150000, 200000, 300000, 500000, 1000000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

X = df[['Position Level']]
y = df['Salary']

# Train a Linear Regression model
linear_model = LinearRegression()
linear_model.fit(X, y)

# Polynomial Regression with degree 2
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
poly_model = LinearRegression()
poly_model.fit(X_poly, y)

# Predictions for Position Levels 11 and 12 (reshaping for consistency)
new_levels = np.array([[11], [12]])
linear_pred = linear_model.predict(new_levels)
poly_pred = poly_model.predict(poly.transform(new_levels))

print("Linear Regression Predictions for Levels 11 and 12:", linear_pred)
print("Polynomial Regression Predictions for Levels 11 and 12:", poly_pred)

# Plotting both models
plt.scatter(df['Position Level'], df['Salary'], color='blue', label="Actual Salaries")
plt.plot(df['Position Level'], linear_model.predict(X), color='green', label="Linear Regression")
plt.plot(df['Position Level'], poly_model.predict(X_poly), color='red', label="Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)")

plt.xlabel("Position Level")
plt.ylabel("Salary")
plt.title("Linear and Polynomial Regression on Salary Position Dataset")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Explanation of Adjustments
new_levels is passed as a 2D array (np.array([[11], [12]])), maintaining the same input format as during training.
This prevents the warning and keeps the input consistent with the fitted model.
Let me know if this resolves the warning or if additional help is needed!

The warning you're seeing is due to the logistic regression model failing to converge within the default number of iterations (max_iter), which is 100. This can happen when the data is not scaled or when the model is struggling to find an optimal solution.

Solutions to resolve the warning:
Increase the number of iterations (max_iter): You can try increasing the number of iterations to allow the logistic regression model more time to converge.

Scale the data: Logistic regression models typically benefit from data scaling (e.g., standardizing features).

Here’s how you can modify your code to handle these issues:

Solution 1: Increase the number of iterations
python
Copy code
# Logistic Regression with increased max_iter
logreg = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=200)
Solution 2: Scale the data before training the models
You can scale your features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler. Here’s how you can add this step:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize and train the models with scaled data
rf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
gb.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
voting_clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
stacking_clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluate the models on the scaled test data
rf_pred = rf.predict(X_test_scaled)
gb_pred = gb.predict(X_test_scaled)
voting_pred = voting_clf.predict(X_test_scaled)
stacking_pred = stacking_clf.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Print accuracy
print(f"Bagging (Random Forest) Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, rf_pred):.2f}")
print(f"Boosting (Gradient Boosting) Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, gb_pred):.2f}")
print(f"Voting Classifier Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, voting_pred):.2f}")
print(f"Stacking Classifier Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, stacking_pred):.2f}")
Additional Notes:
Scaling: Standardizing (zero mean, unit variance) is commonly used with models like Logistic Regression that rely on gradient-based optimization.
max_iter: Increasing the iteration count (max_iter) helps if your data is complex or poorly conditioned for convergence.
These changes should help resolve the convergence warnings and improve the performance of your models.

print(f"Voting Classifier Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, voting_pred):.2f}")

stacking_clf = StackingClassifier(estimators=[('rf', rf), ('gb', gb), ('logreg', logreg)], final_estimator=LogisticRegression())
stacking_clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
stacking_pred = stacking_clf.predict(X_test_scaled)
print(f"Stacking Classifier Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, stacking_pred):.2f}")
Key Changes:
Data Scaling:

Used StandardScaler to scale the features (X_train and X_test) before training the models.
Increased max_iter for Logistic Regression:

Increased max_iter to 200 to prevent convergence warnings in Logistic Regression.
How this helps:
Scaling ensures that all features are on a similar scale, which is especially important for algorithms like logistic regression.
Increased max_iter ensures that the logistic regression model has enough iterations to converge, addressing the convergence warnings you were seeing.
Now, this code should run without warnings and give you the performance of the classifiers with scaled data.

Slip 18 Solutions
1. Implement K-means Algorithm on a Diabetes Dataset
To implement K-means clustering, we will use a synthetic dataset similar to the Diabetes dataset, which is a common dataset for classification but can also be used for clustering. Since no real dataset was provided, we'll create a simple dataset.

Code:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Generate synthetic diabetes dataset with 3 clusters
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.randn(200, 4)  # 200 samples, 4 features (for example: BMI, Age, Glucose, Insulin)

# Create a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['BMI', 'Age', 'Glucose', 'Insulin'])

# Scale the data for better K-means performance
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)

# Apply K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_data)

# Visualize the clusters (Using only 2 features for visualization)
plt.scatter(df['BMI'], df['Age'], c=df['Cluster'], cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('BMI')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.title('K-means Clustering on Diabetes Dataset')
plt.show()

# Evaluate the clustering quality using silhouette score
silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(scaled_data, df['Cluster'])
print(f"Silhouette Score: {silhouette_avg:.2f}")
Explanation:
K-means Clustering: This algorithm clusters the data into groups (or clusters) based on their feature similarities. In this example, we simulated a diabetes dataset with 4 features and applied K-means clustering to divide the dataset into 3 clusters.
Silhouette Score: This score measures how well-separated the clusters are. A higher silhouette score indicates well-defined clusters.
Real-life Example: In healthcare, K-means can be used to classify patients into groups based on similar health metrics (e.g., BMI, age, glucose levels) to provide tailored treatment.
2. Implement Polynomial Linear Regression on a Salary Positions Dataset
For this part, let's assume we have a synthetic dataset for employee salaries. We will apply polynomial regression to predict the salary based on the years of experience (the "Level" column in the dataset).

Code:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Create a synthetic salary dataset
data = {
    'Level': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'Salary': [40000, 45000, 50000, 55000, 60000, 65000, 70000, 80000, 90000, 110000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['Level']].values  # Feature: Level (Years of Experience)
y = df['Salary'].values  # Target: Salary

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply Polynomial Regression (degree 3 for non-linear relationship)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)

# Create a Linear Regression model
lin_reg = LinearRegression()
lin_reg.fit(X_poly, y_train)

# Predict on test set
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)
y_pred = lin_reg.predict(X_test_poly)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")

# Visualize the Polynomial Regression model
plt.scatter(X, y, color='red')  # Scatter plot of actual data points
plt.plot(X, lin_reg.predict(poly.transform(X)), color='blue')  # Polynomial regression line
plt.title('Polynomial Regression (Salary Prediction)')
plt.xlabel('Level (Years of Experience)')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()

# Predict salary for Level 11 and 12 employees
predicted_salary_11 = lin_reg.predict(poly.transform([[11]]))
predicted_salary_12 = lin_reg.predict(poly.transform([[12]]))
print(f"Predicted salary for Level 11: {predicted_salary_11[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted salary for Level 12: {predicted_salary_12[0]:.2f}")
Explanation:
Polynomial Regression: Here, we use polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships between years of experience and salary. It is suitable when the relationship between the input and output variables is curvilinear.
Real-life Example: This is useful in salary prediction, where employee salary may not increase linearly with experience due to factors like promotions or market conditions.
Prediction: For employee levels 11 and 12, we predict their salaries based on the polynomial regression model.
Summary:
K-means Clustering on Diabetes Dataset: The K-means algorithm helps group similar individuals based on their health metrics. This can be used in clustering patient types for medical treatment or intervention planning.
Polynomial Regression on Salary Dataset: Polynomial regression helps predict salaries for employees based on years of experience, considering that the salary growth may not always follow a linear path. This can be applied to salary forecasts or HR analytics.

1. Fit Linear and Polynomial Regression Models to Salary_positions.csv and Predict for Level 11 and 12 Employees
In this part, we will use Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to predict the salaries of employees based on their level (years of experience). For simplicity, we'll create a synthetic salary dataset that mirrors what could be found in a Salary_positions.csv.

Code:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create a synthetic salary dataset for the purpose of this task
data = {
    'Level': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'Salary': [40000, 45000, 50000, 55000, 60000, 65000, 70000, 80000, 90000, 110000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['Level']].values  # Feature: Level (Years of Experience)
y = df['Salary'].values  # Target: Salary

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit a Linear Regression model
lin_reg = LinearRegression()
lin_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict salaries using Linear Regression
y_pred_lin = lin_reg.predict(X_test)

# Apply Polynomial Regression (degree 3 for a non-linear relationship)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)

# Fit a Polynomial Regression model
poly_reg = LinearRegression()
poly_reg.fit(X_poly, y_train)

# Predict salaries using Polynomial Regression
X_test_poly = poly.transform(X_test)
y_pred_poly = poly_reg.predict(X_test_poly)

# Visualize the results
plt.scatter(X, y, color='red')  # Actual data points
plt.plot(X, lin_reg.predict(X), color='blue', label='Linear Regression')
plt.plot(X, poly_reg.predict(poly.transform(X)), color='green', label='Polynomial Regression')
plt.title('Salary Prediction (Linear vs Polynomial)')
plt.xlabel('Level (Years of Experience)')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Predict salary for Level 11 and 12 employees using both models
predicted_salary_lin_11 = lin_reg.predict([[11]])
predicted_salary_lin_12 = lin_reg.predict([[12]])

predicted_salary_poly_11 = poly_reg.predict(poly.transform([[11]]))
predicted_salary_poly_12 = poly_reg.predict(poly.transform([[12]]))

print(f"Linear Regression Prediction for Level 11: {predicted_salary_lin_11[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Linear Regression Prediction for Level 12: {predicted_salary_lin_12[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Polynomial Regression Prediction for Level 11: {predicted_salary_poly_11[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Polynomial Regression Prediction for Level 12: {predicted_salary_poly_12[0]:.2f}")
Explanation:
Linear Regression: This is used to model the relationship between the level (years of experience) and the salary. It assumes a linear relationship.
Polynomial Regression: This method is used when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not linear. It can capture more complex patterns (e.g., salary growth may accelerate over time or at certain levels).
Predictions for Level 11 and 12: After training both models, we predict the salaries for level 11 and 12 employees using both the linear and polynomial regression models.
Real-life Example:
In real business or HR applications, this kind of model can help organizations predict salary growth patterns or estimate salaries for employees based on their years of experience. For instance, you can use polynomial regression to capture non-linear salary growth at higher levels of experience or seniority.

2. Implement Naive Bayes on a Weather Forecast Dataset
For this task, we'll create a synthetic weather dataset where the target is to predict whether it will "rain" based on various weather features (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).

Code:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Create a synthetic weather dataset
data = {
    'Temperature': [30, 22, 25, 28, 20, 15, 10, 18, 24, 29],  # in Celsius
    'Humidity': [60, 85, 80, 70, 90, 95, 60, 65, 80, 70],  # in percentage
    'WindSpeed': [12, 8, 5, 15, 10, 20, 25, 18, 6, 5],  # in km/h
    'Rain': ['Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'No', 'No', 'Yes', 'No']  # Target: Whether it will rain
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Encode the target variable ('Rain') using label encoding (Yes=1, No=0)
df['Rain'] = df['Rain'].map({'Yes': 1, 'No': 0})

# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'WindSpeed']]
y = df['Rain']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Naive Bayes classifier
nb = GaussianNB()

# Train the model
nb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = nb.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Naive Bayes Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
Explanation:
Naive Bayes: The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic model based on Bayes’ theorem. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the target class (rain in this case).
Real-life Example: Naive Bayes is widely used for weather prediction tasks or classification tasks where data points can be represented as categorical features, like predicting if it will rain based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Summary:
Linear and Polynomial Regression on Salary Dataset: We built both linear and polynomial regression models to predict employee salaries based on their experience levels, demonstrating how non-linear relationships can be captured by polynomial regression.
Naive Bayes on Weather Dataset: Using a simple weather dataset, we applied the Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether it will rain based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

1. Implement Ridge and Lasso Regression on boston_houses.csv, Using ‘RM’ and ‘Price’ Columns, and Predict Price for a 5-Room House
In this part, we will implement both Ridge and Lasso regression on the Boston Housing dataset. The RM column represents the average number of rooms per dwelling, and the Price column is the target variable (house price). We'll use these two columns to train the models and predict the price for a 5-room house.

Code:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Boston housing dataset
boston = load_boston()
df = pd.DataFrame(boston.data, columns=boston.feature_names)
df['Price'] = boston.target  # Add target price column to the dataframe

# Select 'RM' (number of rooms) as the feature and 'Price' as the target variable
X = df[['RM']]  # Feature: RM (average number of rooms)
y = df['Price']  # Target: Price (house price)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Implement Ridge Regression
ridge_reg = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Implement Lasso Regression
lasso_reg = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
lasso_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict price for a 5-room house using both models
predicted_price_ridge = ridge_reg.predict([[5]])
predicted_price_lasso = lasso_reg.predict([[5]])

# Output the predicted prices for a 5-room house
print(f"Predicted Price using Ridge Regression for a 5-room house: ${predicted_price_ridge[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted Price using Lasso Regression for a 5-room house: ${predicted_price_lasso[0]:.2f}")

# Visualize the results for Ridge and Lasso regression
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Actual data')
plt.plot(X, ridge_reg.predict(X), color='red', label='Ridge regression line')
plt.plot(X, lasso_reg.predict(X), color='green', label='Lasso regression line')
plt.title('Ridge vs Lasso Regression on Boston Housing Data')
plt.xlabel('Number of Rooms (RM)')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Explanation:
Ridge Regression: Ridge regression adds a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the linear regression cost function. It is particularly useful when there is multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables) or overfitting.

Lasso Regression: Lasso regression adds an L1 penalty to the cost function, which can lead to sparse models by forcing some coefficients to be zero. This is particularly useful for feature selection.

Predictions: For a 5-room house, both Ridge and Lasso models are used to predict the price. The key difference lies in the amount of regularization applied, with Ridge applying L2 regularization and Lasso using L1 regularization.

Real-Life Example:
In a real estate business, Ridge and Lasso regression can be used to predict house prices based on various factors such as the number of rooms, location, and age of the house. The models help in estimating the price and determining which factors influence house pricing the most.

2. Implement Decision Tree for "Play Tennis" Decision-Making
We will create a synthetic dataset to simulate decision-making for playing tennis based on weather conditions. The features will be weather-related (Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind) and the target will be whether to play tennis ("Yes" or "No").

Code:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create a synthetic dataset for "Play Tennis" decision-making
data = {
    'Outlook': ['Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Overcast', 'Rain', 'Rain', 'Rain', 'Overcast', 'Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Rain', 'Sunny', 'Overcast', 'Overcast', 'Rain'],
    'Temperature': ['Hot', 'Hot', 'Hot', 'Mild', 'Cool', 'Cool', 'Mild', 'Mild', 'Cool', 'Mild', 'Mild', 'Mild', 'Hot', 'Mild'],
    'Humidity': ['High', 'High', 'High', 'High', 'High', 'Low', 'Low', 'High', 'Low', 'Low', 'Low', 'High', 'Low', 'High'],
    'Wind': ['Weak', 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Weak', 'Strong', 'Strong', 'Weak', 'Strong'],
    'PlayTennis': ['No', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert categorical features to numerical values using label encoding
df['Outlook'] = df['Outlook'].map({'Sunny': 0, 'Overcast': 1, 'Rain': 2})
df['Temperature'] = df['Temperature'].map({'Hot': 0, 'Mild': 1, 'Cool': 2})
df['Humidity'] = df['Humidity'].map({'High': 0, 'Low': 1})
df['Wind'] = df['Wind'].map({'Weak': 0, 'Strong': 1})
df['PlayTennis'] = df['PlayTennis'].map({'No': 0, 'Yes': 1})

# Split features and target variable
X = df[['Outlook', 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Wind']]
y = df['PlayTennis']

# Initialize the Decision Tree Classifier
dt_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy')

# Train the model
dt_classifier.fit(X, y)

# Predict whether to play tennis based on a new example (e.g., Sunny, Mild, High, Weak Wind)
new_example = pd.DataFrame([[0, 1, 0, 0]], columns=['Outlook', 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Wind'])
prediction = dt_classifier.predict(new_example)

# Output the decision
decision = "Play Tennis" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Do not play tennis"
print(f"Decision: {decision}")

# Visualize the Decision Tree
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plot_tree(dt_classifier, filled=True, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=['Do not play tennis', 'Play tennis'], rounded=True)
plt.title('Decision Tree for Play Tennis')
plt.show()
Explanation:
Decision Tree Classifier: The decision tree algorithm splits the data based on feature values, creating branches for each decision. It is a simple and interpretable model that is often used for decision-making tasks like this one.
Decision Rule: The decision tree uses the conditions of the features (Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind) to predict whether to play tennis.
Prediction: For a new example (e.g., sunny, mild, high humidity, weak wind), the model predicts whether to play tennis.
Real-Life Example:
In a sports or event management context, a decision tree can be used to make decisions based on various conditions. For example, event organizers could use such a model to decide whether to go ahead with an outdoor tennis match based on weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and wind.

Summary:
Ridge and Lasso Regression on Boston Housing Data: We used Ridge and Lasso regression to predict the price of a house based on the number of rooms, showcasing the difference in regularization between the two models.
Decision Tree for Play Tennis Decision-Making: A decision tree classifier was applied to predict whether to play tennis based on weather conditions, which is a classic example of how decision trees can be used for classification tasks.

load_boston has been removed from scikit-learn since version 1.2.

The Boston housing prices dataset has an ethical problem: as
investigated in [1], the authors of this dataset engineered a
non-invertible variable "B" assuming that racial self-segregation had a
positive impact on house prices [2]. Furthermore the goal of the
research that led to the creation of this dataset was to study the
impact of air quality but it did not give adequate demonstration of the
validity of this assumption.

The scikit-learn maintainers therefore strongly discourage the use of
this dataset unless the purpose of the code is to study and educate
about ethical issues in data science and machine learning.

In this special case, you can fetch the dataset from the original
source::

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    data_url = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston"
    raw_df = pd.read_csv(data_url, sep="\s+", skiprows=22, header=None)
    data = np.hstack([raw_df.values[::2, :], raw_df.values[1::2, :2]])
    target = raw_df.values[1::2, 2]

Alternative datasets include the California housing dataset and the
Ames housing dataset. You can load the datasets as follows::

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
    housing = fetch_california_housing()

for the California housing dataset and::

    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    housing = fetch_openml(name="house_prices", as_frame=True)

for the Ames housing dataset.

It seems that the Boston Housing dataset has been removed from scikit-learn due to ethical concerns. However, we can easily switch to a different dataset, such as the California Housing dataset, which is a good alternative for regression tasks like predicting house prices.

Let's modify the code to use the California Housing dataset instead. Here is the updated version of the code:

Updated Code Using California Housing Dataset:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

df['Price'] = california.target  # Add target price column to the dataframe

# Select 'AveRooms' (average number of rooms) as the feature and 'Price' as the target variable
X = df[['AveRooms']]  # Feature: Average number of rooms
y = df['Price']  # Target: House price

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Implement Ridge Regression

plt.title('Ridge vs Lasso Regression on California Housing Data')
plt.xlabel('Average Rooms (AveRooms)')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Explanation:
California Housing Dataset: This dataset provides information about housing prices in California, including various features like the average number of rooms per household (AveRooms). It is a more modern and ethical alternative to the Boston Housing dataset.
Ridge and Lasso Regressions: The Ridge and Lasso regression models are applied to predict house prices based on the average number of rooms per dwelling (AveRooms). The Ridge regression applies L2 regularization, while Lasso applies L1 regularization.
Prediction for 5-room House: The models predict the house price for a hypothetical house with 5 average rooms using the trained Ridge and Lasso models.
Real-Life Example:
In real estate, these models can be used to estimate house prices based on factors like the number of rooms. For instance, a real estate company can use such regression models to estimate property values and help buyers and sellers understand potential pricing for homes with specific features.

Create a multiple linear regression model for house price dataset and predict prices.
Implement Linear SVM using UniversalBank.csv.
Viva (5 Marks)
Let's go step-by-step for the two tasks:

1. Create a Multiple Linear Regression Model for House Price Dataset and Predict Prices
We'll use the California Housing dataset from the previous example as the house price dataset, and implement a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the house prices. We'll use multiple features instead of just one (e.g., AveRooms), like average income, house age, and other features.

Here's the code:

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load California Housing dataset
california = fetch_california_housing()

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(california.data, columns=california.feature_names)
df['Price'] = california.target  # Add target price column to the dataframe

# Select multiple features and target
X = df[['AveRooms', 'AveOccup', 'MedInc', 'HouseAge']]  # Features
y = df['Price']  # Target: House price

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Implement Multiple Linear Regression
mlr_model = LinearRegression()
mlr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict house prices for the test set
y_pred = mlr_model.predict(X_test)

# Output the predicted house prices for the test set
print("Predicted prices for the test set: ", y_pred[:10])  # Display first 10 predictions

# Visualize the results: Plot actual vs predicted prices
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, color='blue')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted House Prices')
plt.xlabel('Actual Prices')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Prices')
plt.show()
Explanation:
Features: We used multiple features from the California Housing dataset like AveRooms (average rooms per household), AveOccup (average occupancy), MedInc (median income), and HouseAge (median age of houses).
Linear Regression Model: We applied Multiple Linear Regression, which is used when there are multiple features that affect the target variable (house price in this case).
Prediction: We predicted house prices for the test set and visualized actual vs predicted values.
2. Implement Linear SVM using UniversalBank.csv
We will use the UniversalBank.csv dataset for this task. However, since the dataset isn't provided here, I will assume a general structure of the dataset that might look like this:

Age: Customer's age
Income: Customer's income
CreditScore: Customer's credit score
LoanAmount: Amount of loan taken
Balance: Bank balance
Purchased: Whether the customer has purchased the product (target)
We'll use Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify whether a customer has purchased the product or not.

Here's the code to implement Linear SVM on this dataset:

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the UniversalBank dataset (replace with actual path if required)
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourdatasetpath/universalbank.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Assume relevant features and target variable
X = df[['Age', 'Income', 'CreditScore', 'LoanAmount', 'Balance']]  # Features
y = df['Purchased']  # Target: Whether the customer purchased the product

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Normalize the feature data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize and train the Linear SVM model
svm_model = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42)
svm_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Predict using the trained model
y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy of Linear SVM model: {accuracy:.2f}")
Explanation:
Linear SVM: We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel to classify whether a customer purchased a product. SVM is a powerful classifier used for binary classification problems.
Data Normalization: Since SVM is sensitive to feature scaling, we applied StandardScaler to normalize the data.
Prediction: The model predicts if a customer purchased the product based on their features like Age, Income, CreditScore, etc.
Viva (5 Marks)
During the viva (oral examination), you might be asked to explain the following:

Linear Regression: What is multiple linear regression, and how does it work when you have multiple features?
Support Vector Machines: How does SVM work, and why do we use it for classification? What is the difference between a linear kernel and non-linear kernels?
Model Evaluation: How do you evaluate regression and classification models? What metrics would you use for these tasks?
Ethics in Data: How do you handle datasets with potential ethical issues, like the Boston Housing dataset?
Real-World Use Cases: How could these models (Linear Regression and SVM) be used in real-world applications?
Real-Time Examples:
Multiple Linear Regression: In real estate, multiple linear regression can predict house prices based on various factors like the number of rooms, location, and house age. Similarly, businesses can predict customer spending based on different features like income, age, and other behavioral data.

Linear SVM: Linear SVM can be used for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a customer will churn or not based on their account activity, or whether a bank customer will purchase a product based on their demographic and financial details.

The error you're seeing occurs because Python interprets backslashes (\) in the file path as escape sequences. To resolve this, you can either:

Escape the backslashes by using double backslashes (\\) in your file path.
Use raw string literals by adding an r before the string to prevent Python from interpreting backslashes as escape sequences.
Here are both ways to fix the issue:

Option 1: Escape the backslashes with double backslashes

Let's create a synthetic dataset for the SVM model, as you requested. We'll simulate a dataset with features like Age, Income, CreditScore, LoanAmount, and Balance, along with a target variable Purchased (whether a customer bought a product). We'll then use this synthetic dataset to fit a Linear SVM model and evaluate its accuracy.

Step-by-step process:
Create a synthetic dataset with random values for features.
Define a target variable (Purchased), which will be binary (0 or 1).
Preprocess the data (split into training and testing sets, scale the features).
Train the Linear SVM model.
Evaluate the model.
Python Code:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Step 1: Create synthetic dataset
np.random.seed(42)

# Generating synthetic data for 1000 customers
data_size = 1000
age = np.random.randint(18, 70, size=data_size)  # Age between 18 and 70
income = np.random.randint(20000, 100000, size=data_size)  # Income between 20k and 100k
credit_score = np.random.randint(300, 850, size=data_size)  # Credit score between 300 and 850
loan_amount = np.random.randint(1000, 50000, size=data_size)  # Loan amount between 1k and 50k
balance = np.random.randint(0, 50000, size=data_size)  # Balance between 0 and 50k

# Creating the target variable: Whether the customer purchased the product (1 or 0)
purchased = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=data_size)

# Creating a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': age,
    'Income': income,
    'CreditScore': credit_score,
    'LoanAmount': loan_amount,
    'Balance': balance,
    'Purchased': purchased
})

# Step 2: Define features (X) and target variable (y)
X = df[['Age', 'Income', 'CreditScore', 'LoanAmount', 'Balance']]  # Features
y = df['Purchased']  # Target: Whether the customer purchased the product

# Step 3: Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Normalize the feature data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Step 5: Initialize and train the Linear SVM model

svm_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Step 6: Predict using the trained model

# Step 7: Evaluate the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy of Linear SVM model on synthetic dataset: {accuracy:.2f}")
Explanation of the dataset:
Age: Randomly generated integers between 18 and 70 years.
Income: Randomly generated values between 20,000 and 100,000.
CreditScore: Random values between 300 and 850 (common range for credit scores).
LoanAmount: Randomly generated loan amounts between 1,000 and 50,000.
Balance: Random bank account balance between 0 and 50,000.
Result:
Running the code will print the accuracy of the Linear SVM model based on this synthetic dataset. The accuracy value indicates how well the model predicts whether a customer purchased the product (Purchased = 1) or not (Purchased = 0) based on the given features.

This approach simulates a real-world scenario where we may not have access to specific datasets but can generate useful data for model training.

Use Apriori algorithm on groceries dataset to find items bought together (min support = 0.25).
I'll first walk you through the Simple Linear Regression implementation for predicting house prices and then implement the Apriori algorithm for finding frequently bought items in a groceries dataset.

1. Implement Simple Linear Regression for predicting house price:
To implement simple linear regression, let's create a synthetic dataset where we will predict a house's price based on the number of rooms.

Code for Simple Linear Regression:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create a synthetic dataset for house prices

# Generating data for 1000 houses
house_size = np.random.randint(1, 6, size=1000)  # House size (number of rooms) between 1 and 5
price = house_size * 50000 + np.random.randint(10000, 50000, size=1000)  # Price based on number of rooms

y = df['Price']  # Target (Price)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Initialize and train the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 5: Visualize the regression line
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue')  # Actual points
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red')  # Regression line
plt.xlabel('House Size (Number of Rooms)')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('Linear Regression for House Price Prediction')
plt.show()

# Step 6: Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"R-squared value for the model: {accuracy:.2f}")
Explanation:
HouseSize: The number of rooms in the house (feature).
Price: The price of the house, which depends on the number of rooms (target).
We split the dataset into training and testing sets, train a linear regression model, and visualize the results with a regression line.
Result:
The R-squared value will indicate how well the model fits the data. A value closer to 1 indicates a good fit.
2. Use Apriori Algorithm on Groceries Dataset to Find Items Bought Together (min support = 0.25):
For the Apriori algorithm, we need a dataset where we can analyze item transactions. We'll use the mlxtend library to implement the Apriori algorithm. Let's first create a synthetic "groceries" dataset.

Code for Apriori Algorithm:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

# Create a synthetic groceries dataset
groceries_data = {
    'Milk': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    'Bread': [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    'Butter': [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'Eggs': [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    'Cheese': [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(groceries_data)

# Step 1: Apply Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets with a minimum support of 0.25
frequent_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=0.25, use_colnames=True)

# Step 2: Generate association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1)

# Step 3: Display the frequent itemsets and the association rules
print("Frequent Itemsets:")
print(frequent_itemsets)

print("\nAssociation Rules:")
print(rules)

# Step 4: Filter rules where the consequent (right-hand side) is 'Milk' (Example)
milk_rules = rules[rules['consequents'].apply(lambda x: 'Milk' in x)]
print("\nAssociation Rules where Milk is in the consequent:")
print(milk_rules)
Explanation:
Groceries dataset: Contains transactions with binary values (1 if an item was bought, 0 if it wasn't).
Apriori: We apply the Apriori algorithm with a minimum support of 0.25 to find itemsets that appear together frequently.
Association Rules: These rules describe the relationships between items that are frequently purchased together. The lift metric helps assess the strength of the rule.
Result:
The Frequent Itemsets section shows the items that often appear together.
The Association Rules section contains the rules like "if a customer buys Bread, they are likely to buy Milk".
Summary:
Simple Linear Regression was used to predict house prices based on the number of rooms.
Apriori Algorithm was applied to a synthetic groceries dataset to find frequently bought items and generate association rules.

Code for Linear and Polynomial Regression:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create a synthetic dataset for Salary and Position
np.random.seed(42)

# Generating data for employee levels and their corresponding salaries
levels = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
salaries = np.array([45000, 50000, 55000, 60000, 65000, 70000, 75000, 80000, 85000, 90000, 100000, 110000])

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Level': levels, 'Salary': salaries})

# Visualize the data
plt.scatter(df['Level'], df['Salary'], color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Employee Level')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.title('Employee Salary Prediction')
plt.show()

# Step 1: Linear Regression
X = df[['Level']]
y = df['Salary']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Linear Regression model
linear_regressor = LinearRegression()
linear_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict salaries using the linear model
y_pred_linear = linear_regressor.predict(X_test)

# Visualize the linear regression line
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue')
plt.plot(X, linear_regressor.predict(X), color='red')
plt.xlabel('Employee Level')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.title('Linear Regression for Employee Salary Prediction')
plt.show()

# Step 2: Polynomial Regression
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=4)  # Degree 4 polynomial for a curve fit
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

# Split the polynomial transformed data into training and testing sets
X_train_poly, X_test_poly, y_train_poly, y_test_poly = train_test_split(X_poly, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Polynomial Regression model
poly_regressor = LinearRegression()
poly_regressor.fit(X_train_poly, y_train_poly)

plt.plot(X, poly_regressor.predict(poly.fit_transform(X)), color='green')
plt.xlabel('Employee Level')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.title('Polynomial Regression for Employee Salary Prediction')
plt.show()

# Step 3: Predict salary for levels 11 and 12
predicted_salary_linear_11 = linear_regressor.predict([[11]])
predicted_salary_linear_12 = linear_regressor.predict([[12]])

predicted_salary_poly_11 = poly_regressor.predict(poly.fit_transform([[11]]))
predicted_salary_poly_12 = poly_regressor.predict(poly.fit_transform([[12]]))

print(f"Linear Regression Prediction for Level 11: {predicted_salary_linear_11[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Linear Regression Prediction for Level 12: {predicted_salary_linear_12[0]:.2f}")

print(f"Polynomial Regression Prediction for Level 11: {predicted_salary_poly_11[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Polynomial Regression Prediction for Level 12: {predicted_salary_poly_12[0]:.2f}")
Explanation:
Linear Regression: A basic regression model that fits a straight line to the data.
Polynomial Regression: Extends the linear regression to fit a polynomial curve (in this case, degree 4) to the data, capturing more complex patterns.
Result:
The linear and polynomial regression models are fitted to the synthetic salary data.
Predictions for levels 11 and 12 are made, showing how both models perform on those levels.
2. Find and Remove Null Values from a Dataset:
Now, let's create a small dataset with some missing (null) values and then remove those null values.

Code for Removing Null Values:
python
Copy code
# Create a dataset with some null values
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
    'Age': [25, 30, np.nan, 35, 40],
    'Salary': [50000, np.nan, 70000, 80000, 95000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Show the dataset with null values
print("Original Dataset with Null Values:")
print(df)

# Step 1: Find null values
print("\nCheck for null values:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Step 2: Remove rows with null values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

# Show the cleaned dataset
print("\nDataset after removing rows with null values:")
print(df_cleaned)
Explanation:
Null Values: We intentionally inserted np.nan values in the dataset to simulate missing data.
Removing Null Values: The .dropna() function is used to remove rows with any null values.
Result:
The dataset is cleaned, and rows with missing values are removed, resulting in a new, cleaned dataset.
Summary:
Linear and Polynomial Regression were implemented to predict employee salaries based on their levels, and predictions were made for levels 11 and 12.
Null values in a dataset were identified and removed using the .isnull() and .dropna() methods.

y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1])  # Binary classification target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Neural Network with two layers: ReLU activation for hidden layer and Sigmoid for output layer

y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy of KNN model: {accuracy:.2f}")
Explanation:
We load the Indian Diabetes Dataset and prepare it by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Cross-validation is used to find the optimal K (number of neighbors) by evaluating accuracy scores for different K values (from 1 to 20).
The K value that provides the highest cross-validation score is selected as the optimal K.
The KNN classifier is trained with the optimal K value, and the model is evaluated on the test set using accuracy.
2. Use the Apriori Algorithm on the Groceries Dataset to Find Items Bought Together (Min Support = 0.25)
For this task, we will use the Apriori algorithm to find association rules in a groceries dataset. The Apriori algorithm helps to identify frequent itemsets and association rules, such as which items are often bought together.

Code for Apriori Algorithm:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

# Example Groceries dataset
# Let's assume a simple dataset where each row represents a transaction, and the items bought are in columns.
data = {
    'Milk': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'Bread': [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    'Butter': [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    'Eggs': [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    'Cheese': [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Apply the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets with min support of 0.25
frequent_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=0.25, use_colnames=True)

# Generate the association rules from the frequent itemsets
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=1)

# Display the rules
print("Frequent Itemsets:")
print(frequent_itemsets)

print("\nAssociation Rules:")
print(rules)
Explanation:
We create a synthetic groceries dataset where each row represents a transaction, and columns represent items bought in each transaction (binary format: 1 means bought, 0 means not bought).
We use the Apriori algorithm from the mlxtend library to find frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold of 0.25 (meaning the itemsets must appear in at least 25% of transactions).
Association rules are generated from these frequent itemsets to find relationships like "if milk is bought, then bread is also bought."
The lift metric is used to measure the strength of the rules, and the minimum threshold for lift is set to 1 (indicating that the items are bought together more often than by chance).
Summary:
The KNN model was created to predict diabetes status, and we found the optimal number of neighbors (K) using cross-validation.
The Apriori algorithm was applied to a synthetic groceries dataset to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules, revealing which items are often bought together.

    'Salary': [45000, 50000, 55000, 60000, 65000, 70000, 75000, 80000, 85000, 90000]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features (X) and target (y)
X = df[['Level']]
y = df['Salary']

# Fit the Linear Regression model
linear_model = LinearRegression()
linear_model.fit(X, y)

# Fit the Polynomial Regression model (degree=3)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
polynomial_model = LinearRegression()
polynomial_model.fit(X_poly, y)

# Predict the salary for Level 11 and 12 using both models
level_11_12 = np.array([[11], [12]])

linear_pred = linear_model.predict(level_11_12)
polynomial_pred = polynomial_model.predict(poly.transform(level_11_12))

print(f"Predicted salary for Level 11 (Linear Regression): {linear_pred[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted salary for Level 12 (Linear Regression): {linear_pred[1]:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted salary for Level 11 (Polynomial Regression): {polynomial_pred[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted salary for Level 12 (Polynomial Regression): {polynomial_pred[1]:.2f}")

# Visualize the results
plt.scatter(X, y, color='red')
plt.plot(X, linear_model.predict(X), label='Linear Regression', color='blue')
plt.plot(X, polynomial_model.predict(poly.transform(X)), label='Polynomial Regression', color='green')
plt.xlabel('Level')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.title('Linear vs Polynomial Regression')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Explanation:
A synthetic salary dataset is created, where each row represents an employee's level and their corresponding salary.

# List of SVM kernels
kernels = ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid']

# Loop through each kernel type and evaluate the model
for kernel in kernels:
    # Initialize and train the SVM model with the specified kernel
    svm_model = SVC(kernel=kernel)
    svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions on the test data
    y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Evaluate the model's accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Accuracy with {kernel} kernel: {accuracy:.2f}")
Explanation:
We load the Iris dataset, which contains data on three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
We then loop through different SVM kernel types (linear, polynomial, radial basis function (rbf), and sigmoid).
For each kernel, an SVM model is trained and evaluated using accuracy.
Summary:
Multinomial Naive Bayes is used to categorize news articles into 20 different categories, and we evaluate the performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

Explanation:
PCA is applied to the Iris dataset to reduce its dimensionality from 4 features to 2. This makes it easier to visualize the data.
After applying PCA, an SVM classifier is trained on the 2D data, and its accuracy is evaluated on the test set.
We visualize the PCA-reduced data in a 2D scatter plot where the colors represent different flower species.
2. Use K-means Clustering for Income Group Classification and Determine K Using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
In this task, we will use K-means clustering to classify individuals into income groups. We will also determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using the elbow method and silhouette score.

python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Create a sample income dataset (you can replace it with your actual dataset)
data = {
    'Income': [30000, 50000, 70000, 90000, 120000, 150000, 180000, 220000, 250000, 300000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Reshape the data for K-means
X = df.values

# Elbow method to determine optimal k
inertia = []
silhouette_scores = []
k_range = range(2, 11)  # Test k values from 2 to 10

for k in k_range:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X)
    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)
    silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_score(X, kmeans.labels_))

# Plot the Elbow method graph

# Choose optimal k based on elbow and silhouette score (let's assume k=3 is optimal based on plots)

optimal_k = 3
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Add cluster labels to the dataset
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Display the clustered data
print("\nIncome Groups (Clusters):")
print(df)
Explanation:
A small synthetic income dataset is created. You can replace this with real data, such as individual income information.
The elbow method is used to find the optimal number of clusters (k). The inertia is calculated for each k, and the elbow point is identified by looking for a sharp decrease in inertia.
The silhouette score is also calculated to assess the quality of the clusters. A higher score indicates better clustering.
We visualize both the elbow method and silhouette score to determine the optimal k.
Finally, we perform K-means clustering with the chosen optimal k and display the resulting income groups (clusters).
Summary:
PCA was used to reduce the Iris dataset from 4D to 2D, and an SVM classifier was trained and evaluated on the reduced data.
K-means clustering was applied to a synthetic income dataset, and the optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method and silhouette score. The final clusters were displayed with the income groups.
